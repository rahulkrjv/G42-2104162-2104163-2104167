## Project Overview

The G42 project is a web application designed to assist users in writing and optimizing Python code. It provides an interactive coding environment with features such as code completion, optimization, and error detection. The application uses Flask for the backend, Socket.IO for real-time communication, and various third-party libraries for code analysis and optimization.

## Features

The G42 project includes the following features:

- Real-time code editor with error highlighting and diagnostics
- Code completion suggestions using a local language model
- Code optimization suggestions using a local language model
- Custom code transformation using a local language model
- Integration with Flake8 for code linting
- Terminal output for running Python code
